Border-Radius Previewer

This is a project I put together almost completely on my own.

I had some trouble with specifying the border radius for each specific input using React. I reached out to stack overflow for help and I was able to complete the project.

The previewer allows you to create unique shapes based on the inputs. The input values you can use are: top left, top right, bottom right, and bottom left.

Technologies:
- React JS
